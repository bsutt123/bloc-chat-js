# Chatty - Angular

This is a simple chatting service which is created as a slack like clone that uses Angular and Firebase Realtime Database to implement the frontend and backend respectively

## Motivation

Chatty or a chatting service is general is what I use when I want to learn a new front end framework but I want to solve a problem that I already know most of the answers to. Its very interesting to get started with a new framework and see the kind of advantages and disadvantages that they have in comparison to the other frameworks.

I made this version of Chatty after the Angular Version but before the version for React or Vue. It was good practice with AngularJS, but it was also a real eye opening experience to see how much better modern frameworks are at creating Single Page Applications, and made me understand why Google decided to make a breaking versioning change when moving from AngularJS to Angular.


## Local Installation

After cloning the repository locally you can get started by just installing the dependencies and then the server

You should be able to navigate to `http:localhost:3000` and see the site.

## Future Work

I do not intend to significantly change or add to this project, and as such there is no future work planned and I am not merging pull requests in
